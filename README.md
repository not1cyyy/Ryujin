## Demos and Presentations

Ryūjin was designed and developed for the study of obfuscators with Bin2Bin capabilities, making it a viable project for use by third parties as well as serious information security students. This includes: Commercial Developers, Indie Developers/Cheat Developers, Anti-Cheat Developers, Malware Developers, Malware Analysts, and Security Researchers.

**A Simple Comparison on a "main" function. before and after applying Ryūjin:**

This is only a small demo with only one Ryūjin feature, others feature together produce a better result.

**Really Easy to Use:**

**Ryūjin** is extremely easy to use — you can choose between the GUI mode or the CLI mode. Both will produce the same result in a precise, functional, and stable way.

GUI Mode Demonstration:

CLI Mode Demonstration:

For both options, you will need exclusively a PE file (Apanas, executable, for now) along with a PDB file containing the symbols for that PE file, so that you can protect and generate a new binary. Additionally, you can consult the WIKI at any time to discover other options and possibilities, such as custom passes.
